      <h2>About Me</h2>      
      <p>
        I am a college freshman at <a src="https://www.ucf.edu/">UCF</a>, majoring in <a src="https://www.ucf.edu/degree/electrical-engineering-bsee/">Electrical</a>/<a src="https://www.ucf.edu/degree/electrical-engineering-bsee/">Computer engineering</a>. I enjoy learning and solving complex problems, optimizing systems, and experimenting with new technology. Knowledge alone isn’t useful; it requires wisdom to combine that knowledge with the appropriate circumstance to build something incredible.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
      Among my many pursuits, I am primarily interested in rationality, memory improvement, <a src="https://www.ucf.edu/degree/electrical-engineering-bsee/">Obsidian</a>, computer programming, Apple development, web development, Artificial Intelligence, blockchains, cybersecurity, linguistics, origami, paper mache, crochet, gardening, and reading. My goal is to learn enough to combine these topics to develop new ideas.
      <br><br>
In my free time, I enjoy reading books and articles on improving myself related to my other interests. Sometimes this means psychology books, like <a src="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">Thinking Fast and Slow</a>; other times, this means learning the <a src="https://neography.info/phonetics-and-ipa/#IPA">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> to design multilingual fantasy scripts with adaptive phonetics so that I could later build entire languages.
      </p>

      <h2>Life Plans</h2>
      <p>
      During high school, I focused on leadership training through <a src="https://fl286.cap.gov/">Civil Air Patrol</a>, robotics through the underwater <a src="https://materovcompetition.org/">MATE ROV competition</a>, and cybersecurity through <a src="https://www.nationalcyberscholarship.org/ncsf-winners-2024#:~:text=Corban%20Pendrak,-%2D%20Home%20Schooled%20%2D%20Florida">CyberStart America</a>, <a src="https://picoctf.org/">PicoCTF</a>, and <a src="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/">CyberPatriot</a>.
      <br><br>
This summer I worked on a tech internship at <a src="http://riovistachurch.com/">Rio Vista Church</a> and prepared to head to UCF in the fall.
<br><br>
In college, I am studying electrical engineering for a career in robotics programming or cybersecurity. I have always been interested in space science. Ultimately, I want to make something like self-improving AI, or robots for space. 
<br><br>
If I can’t be perfect, I can continue to improve myself as close as possible.
