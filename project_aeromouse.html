        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          We were inspired a bit by extremely ergonomic science fiction
          controllers and the Nintendo Wii remote with that magical feeling of
          controlling a fine tuned cursor from a distance with just hand
          gestures. Picture this: you're lounging on your couch, wanting to
          browse the internet or control a presentation, but you're physically
          chained to a flat surface by the ancient mouse. Sure, presentation
          clickers "work", but they allow for little control, and remotes
          "work", but they require carefully pointing at a tiny button. After 40
          years of desktop tyranny, we asked ourselves - why are we still
          tethered to flat surfaces? The vision was simple yet revolutionary:
          <strong>your computer, un-tethered</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>What AeroMouse Does</h2>
        <p>
          AeroMouse is a wireless air mouse that translates natural hand
          gestures into precise cursor control using advanced sensor fusion
          technology. Hold it like a TV remote and simply:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Tilt</strong> to move the cursor horizontally and vertically
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Click</strong> buttons for left/right/middle mouse functions
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Double-tap</strong> middle button to switch to scroll mode
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Perfect for entertainment systems, presentations, couch computing, or
          anyone tired of being physically restricted to a desk setup. Even
          sitting at a regular desk, AeroMouse allows for the comfort of leaning
          back or moving without stretching your hand awkwardly. No drivers, no
          dongles, no hassle - just pure freedom through Bluetooth connectivity.
        </p>
        <h2>The Building Blocks of Our Vision</h2>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>The Hardware</h3>
          <p>We started with humble components but ambitious goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>ESP32 DevKit</strong> as our brain (thanks to the IEEE
              workshop!)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>MPU6050</strong> 6-axis IMU sensor for tracking
              orientation
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>3 push buttons</strong> for full mouse functionality
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Breadboard foundation</strong> for rapid prototyping
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Originally, we intended to use a Raspberry Pi based system, like the
            Raspberry Pi Zero, but with challenges with connecting to the
            device, we pivoted to using the ESP32. While a released product
            would feature much nicer case, we used a breadboard for easier
            testing and demonstrating the functionality. To improve the form, we
            used wires, rather than jumper cables for the breadboard.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>The Software Revolution</h3>
          <p>
            The real work happened in the code. We handcoded the design and
            implemented sophisticated algorithms for nice cursor tracking.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Complementary Filter</strong>: Fuses gyroscope with custom
              curves for rock-solid tracking
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adaptive Bias Correction</strong>: Automatically
              compensates for sensor drift using Kalman-lite approach
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-linear Response Curves</strong>: Separate mathematical
              curves for cursor vs scroll modes
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Momentum System</strong>: Captures those subtle, slow
              movements with 0.88 decay rate
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Health Monitoring</strong>: Automatic I2C recovery when
              sensors misbehave
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We wrote the code in C/C++ using Arduino IDE, to have better low
            level access and customization. We used the ESP32 BLE Mouse library
            to wirelessly connect our device as a Bluetooth HID mouse.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Challenges We Conquered</h2>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>Team Coordination and Work</h3>
          <p>
            With only 2 ESP32s for 4 team members during the hackathon crunch,
            we had to get creative with collaboration. Additionally, with such a
            linear hardware project, where the connection required the gyroscope
            which required the buttons, it was hard to work together on some of
            the sections. Despite this, we divided the tasks along roughly
            obvious categories and worked together as much as possible. With our
            extra team power, we created a product website and polished it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>Precision vs. Usability</h3>
          <p>
            Our biggest technical challenge was achieving the perfect balance
            between sensitivity, stability, and the gyroscope's own limitations.
            Too sensitive meant the mouse was too jittery. Too slow meant
            sluggish frustration. We solved this with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Multiple sensitivity modes</strong> (Low/Medium/High)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Smart deadzone algorithms</strong> to eliminate
              micro-movements
            </li>
            <li><strong>Exponential smoothing</strong> for smooth tracking</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We originally wrote all of our code <strong>by hand</strong>, which
            worked well, but the cursor was <em>not as smooth</em> as any
            commercial product. After building the working demo code ourselves,
            we decided to have AI write some custom curve algorithms for us as a
            last minute experiment to improve the controls. After several failed
            attempts with Gemini, which possibly made the code worse, and
            Copilot, which just made it wrong in different ways, Claude rewrote
            the majority of the code in an iterative experimentation process
            that resulted in a much smoother mouse, which has ended up being our
            final submission. So, the majority of our code will flag as AI
            produced, because these final rewrites changed the code
            significantly, but
            <strong>we originally wrote all of the code ourselves</strong>. If
            we had more time, we might have been able to code the customized
            calibration curves ourselves, but even working with AI, we needed to
            revise the code several times to achieve the best functionality.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>Gyroscope Accuracy</h3>
          <p>
            Initially the MPU6050 gyroscope wasn't quite meeting our precision
            expectations. Our code (pre-AI) worked, but we ran into issues with
            the gyroscope precision, where small movements would be ignored and
            the gyroscope would reset its heading. This made for a very
            difficult challenge that we just didn't have time to fix. However,
            with some help from AI and <strong>several</strong> rounds of
            testing lasting into the early morning before the submission
            deadline, we developed custom calibration controls to mitigate this
            error.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>Library Troubles</h3>
          <p>
            The T-vK ESP32 BLE Mouse library saved us a lot of work, which we
            immediately used for exploring hardware alternatives, improving the
            calibration, and building a website. However, it wouldn't originally
            run for us because of some type conversion errors in the library
            itself, and we almost had to rewrite the entire library from
            scratch. Thankfully, our team found the problem, fixed the library
            by hand, and compiled the code correctly for the rest of the team,
            all while multitask attending some of the great workshops hosted at
            the hackathon.

        <h2>Accomplishments That Make Us Proud</h2>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>We Shipped a Complete Product!</h3>
          <p>
            In just 36 hours, we created a
            <strong>WORKING LIVE PRODUCT</strong> that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Seamlessly connects to all computers that support Bluetooth
              normally (Mac, Windows, most Linux...)
            </li>
            <li>
              Registers with the computer identically to a traditional mouse (so
              no weird connection issues)
            </li>
            <li>
              Includes expected UX features like drag &amp; drop and scroll
              modes (makes for a nicer experience)
            </li>
            <li>
              Self-calibrates and recovers from errors automatically (all with a
              sarcastic attitude)
            </li>
            <li>
              Provides intuitive gesture-based control (no more flat mice!)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While we technically had ~36 hours for the competition, with
            planning, failed attempts with the Raspberry Pi, and a health(ish)
            sleep schedule, we completed the project in more like
            <strong>12 hours</strong>, but even during this time, we made space
            to attend intereting workshops, the career fair, meals, and a few
            rounds of video games to keep the environment fun.
          </p>

        <div class="box">
          <h3>Technical Breakthroughs We Achieved</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced sensor fusion</strong>: rivaling commercial
              motion controllers
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Zero-driver installation</strong>: works instantly via
              Bluetooth HID
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Power optimization</strong>: for extended battery life
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Robust error recovery</strong>: that keeps working even
              when sensors glitch
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multi-modal operation</strong>: supporting cursor, scroll,
              and precision modes
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Although we didn't have a battery pack to connect the mouse to, the
            mouse is wireless, so it can be plugged into the wall, a computer,
            or a portable battery.

        <h2>What We Learned</h2>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>From Zero to Hardware Heroes</h3>
          <p>
            Most of our team entered this hackathon with minimal hardware
            experience, but the motivation to try something new and have fun
            along the way. Because of a lack in embedded hardware mentorship, we
            ended up learning everything on the fly ourselves as we built the
            mouse. Through countless pinout diagrams, datasheets, and
            trial-and-error moments, we now genuinely understand:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Breadboarding fundamentals</strong> and circuit design
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Embedded software development</strong> and real-time

            <li>
              <strong>Bluetooth protocols</strong> and HID device implementation
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <h3>The Art of Ambitious Project Management</h3>
          <p>
            We learned that ambitious projects require not just technical
            skills, but strategic thinking about scope, team coordination, and
            time management under pressure. Even a linear project can be broken
            down into collaborative steps, and free team members can continue
            working on other aspects of the project design.

        <h2>The Future of AeroMouse</h2>
        <p>
          Our time at this hackathon was short, but our project still has a lot
          of potential! If we had the extra time, here are some of the things we
          would improve.

          <p>
            AeroMouse actually addresses real pain points in the computer mouse

            A commercialization plan is way beyond our current scope, but if we
            can make a marketable product (not just wired to a breadboard) this
